# MERV 
Mission Exploration and Research of Venus is a project ran by a group of students at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona in the 
[**Undergraduate Team Space Design Competition RFP â€“ Human Enabled Venus Robotic Exploration**](https://www.aiaa.org/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/membership-and-communities/university-students/design-competitions/2023-24-aiaa-space-system-design-competition_human-enabled-venus-robotic-exploration.pdf?sfvrsn=aee1eefd_0]) held by AIAA. 

The concept of the mission is develop a near-surface Venus balloon hovering around the **goldilocks zone** around **45-55km** from the Venusian surface to collect scientific data on the atmosphere and analyze the minerals and surface composition while being supported by a crew of 4 orbiting around Venus in a 30 day time span.
